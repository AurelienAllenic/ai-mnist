cnn.ipynb = the training file for our AI  
cnn.pth = the model of our AI  
convert_to_onnx.py = used to transform our .pth model into a .onnx file  
mnist_cnn.onnx = the usable file of the AI model, generated by the conversion file  
index.html, index.js and styles.css = files necessary to run the app  
requirements.txt = file containing all the necessary packages list to install to run the app
